### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
###### Feel free to check out the links at the end.


## Tech interests
Currently I would describe myself as a full stack web developer with a preference for BE related work.
<br/>
This preference comes from my interest in creating (complex) functionality in software. 
<br/>
How things look always get pushed aside.
<br/>
### Current projects

## Studies

### Current Semester

<br/>
Here I am working on a system called Flowcontrol. This system is created to digitalize the business process of Limax.

<br/>
Unfortunately, is my work stored in a private repository due to confidentiality.
