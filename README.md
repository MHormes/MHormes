### Hi there 👋
###### Feel free to check out the links at the end.


## Tech interests
I am a full-stack software engineer with a preference for BE related work.
<br/>
This preference comes from my interest in designing software and creating (complex) functionality. 
<br/>
I use my strong **organizational skills** to keep an **overview** and ensure all facets of the solution are covered and properly integrated.

### Side project
-  [Clipper-MS](https://www.clipper-ms.com/) - A clipper lighter collection system.<br/>

This system came into existance from my own need of tracking my collection
