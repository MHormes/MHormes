### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
###### Feel free to check out the links at the end.


## Tech interests
I am a full stack web developer with a preference for BE related work.
<br/>
This preference comes from my interest in creating (complex) functionality in software. 
<br/>
How things look always get pushed aside.

## Studies
Currently. I am a 3rd year student at HBO-ICT & Software engineering located at Fontys Eindhoven.
