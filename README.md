### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
###### Feel free to check out the links at the end.


## Tech interests
Currently I would describe myself as a full stack web developer with a preference for BE related work.
<br/>
This preference comes from my interest in creating (complex) functionality in software. 
<br/>
How things look always get pushed aside.
<br/>
### Current projects
At this moment I am working on one (1) side project.
 - [ClipperMS](https://github.com/MHormes/Clipper-MS) - A management system for collectable Clipper lighters

## Experience
### Developed with: 
 - C# 
 - Java (Spring)
 - JavaScript (React.js / Vue.js)
### Some experience in:
 - PHP
 - MySQL
 - HTML/CSS

## Studies
Currently I am a 3rd year student at HBO-ICT & Software engineering located at Fontys Eindhoven.
### Current Semester
In this current semester (#5) I am following an Internship at Limax B.v.
<br/>
Here I am working on a system called Flowcontrol. This system is created to digitalize the business process of Limax.
<br/>
My assignment is to analyze and improve the current security implementation.
<br/>
Unfortunately, is my work stored in a private repository due to confidentiality.

## Ambitions 
 - Become a self employed full stack (web) developer, which should open up the opportunity of remote working.
 - Work as a digital nomad of some sorts.
 - Release a fully functional, widely used, web/mobile application.
